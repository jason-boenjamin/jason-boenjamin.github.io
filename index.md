## About Me

My name is **Jason Boenjamin** and I am a third year transfer student at ***UCSD*** majoring in Computer Science. I was born on May 10th, 2003, in Arcadia, CA and attended Pasadena City College. The San Gabriel Valley will always have a special place in my heart, especially because of the amazing food there. 

Also, I run a sneaker business on Instagram, with the handle @626sneaks.

Attached *below* is an image about the business.

On the topic of sneakers, my favorite quote comes from the Great Kobe Bryant > Leave the game better than you found it. And when it comes time for you to leave, leave a legend."

This quote is my idealogy for the way I want to live my life. I want to leave a legacy to those around me. Whether it be a simple interaction with me or a group project. I want to have a positive impact on every person I come across. 

Speaking of quotes, my favorite line of *code* is `cout << "Hello World\n";`
